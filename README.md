# async-in-depth-rust-series

This is the repository for an the [Async in Depth Series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLb1VOxJqFzDd05_aDQEm6KVblhee_KStX) I did on my [Youtube Channel](https://youtube.com/c/nyxtom).
The main purpose of this project was to determine how to reason about async programming in general, what non-blocking vs blocking operations consist of, 
and a way to build concepts up on one another.
